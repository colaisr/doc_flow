4. Replace merge fields: `{{lead.full_name}}` → actual value (HTML-escaped)
5. Preserve signature block structure (overlay handled in frontend)
6. Generate rendered HTML and document title
7. Create Document record with `status = 'draft'`

**Document Creation from Lead Page:**
- "צור חוזה חדש" (Create New Contract) button on Lead Details page
- Opens `CreateDocumentModal` component
- Modal first asks for contract type selection: Buyer, Seller, or Lawyer
- Then displays list of available templates for organization
- User selects contract type and template
- Document is generated with merged lead data and `contract_type` set
- Initial status: `'draft'` (can be edited)
- Signature blocks copied from template to document
- Automatic redirect to unified Google Docs-style editor (`/documents/[id]/edit`) after creation
- Documents list on lead page refreshes automatically

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": 10,
  "title": "Real Estate Purchase Agreement - John Doe",
  "rendered_content": "<h1>Purchase Agreement</h1><p>This agreement is between John Doe and...</p>",
  "status": "draft",
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

---

### 8.2 Document Rendering Logic

**Merge Field Replacement:**
- Pattern: `{{lead.<field_key>}}`
- Lookup in Lead model fixed columns (130+ fields)
- Replace with actual value or empty string
- HTML escape values to prevent XSS
- RTL preserved (wrapping when missing)

**Signature Placeholder Handling:**
- Signature blocks stored as JSON on template; rendered via overlay on frontend
- Content left intact; blocks handled separately on view/sign

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

---

## 9. ELECTRONIC SIGNING

### 9.1 Signing Flow

#### Contract Workflow:
1. **Document Creation:** User creates contract from template on Lead Details page
   - Selects contract type: Buyer, Seller, or Lawyer
   - Selects template
   - Document created with `status='draft'`, `contract_type` set, signature blocks copied from template
   - Redirects to unified editor (`/documents/[id]/edit`)

2. **Contract Editing:** User edits contract in Google Docs-style editor
   - Can fully rework content and signature blocks
   - Saves as draft multiple times until ready
   - Clicks "Mark as Ready" → `status='ready'`, lead stage advances:
     - Buyer contract → "חוזה לקוח מוכן" (Buyer Contract Ready)
     - Seller contract → "חוזה מוכר מוכן" (Seller Contract Ready)
     - Lawyer contract → "חוזה עורך דין מוכן" (Lawyer Contract Ready)

3. **Signing Link Creation:** On Lead Details page, contract card shows signing actions
   - For ready contracts: "צור קישור" (Create Link) button
   - Clicking creates signing link and automatically copies to clipboard
   - `status` updates to `'sent'`
   - Link can be sent to customer via any method (email, WhatsApp, etc.)

4. **Client Signing:** Customer receives public link
   - Customer opens link: `GET /api/public/sign/{token}`
   - Views document with signature blocks positioned
   - Signs document: `POST /api/public/sign/{token}/sign`
   - Document `status` updates to `'signed'`
   - Lead stage auto-advances:
     - Buyer contract → "חתום על ידי לקוח" (Buyer Signed)
     - Seller contract → "חתום על ידי מוכר" (Seller Signed)
     - Lawyer contract → "חתום על ידי עורך דין" (Lawyer Signed)
   - Contract moves to "מסמכים חתומים" (Signed Documents) tab

5. **Contract Management:**
   - Draft/ready/sent contracts shown in "חוזים לחתימה" (Contracts to Sign) tab
   - Signed contracts shown in "מסמכים חתומים" (Signed Documents) tab
   - Signing links accessible directly from contract cards (copy/open buttons)

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

---

### 9.2 Create Signing Link

#### For Client (Public Link)
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/documents/{id}/signing-links`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "intended_signer_email": "client@example.com",  // Optional
  "expires_in_days": 7  // Optional (None = no expiration)
}
```

**Note:** `signer_type` removed - all public signing links are implicitly 'client' type. The `contract_type` on the document determines which stage to advance to when signed.

**Process:**
1. Creates signing link with secure UUID token
2. Generates full signing URL: `{FRONTEND_BASE_URL}/public/sign/{token}`
3. Stores URL in `Document.signing_url` field
4. Updates document `status` to `'sent'` (if it was `'ready'`)
5. Returns signing URL for immediate use

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": 20,
  "token": "abc123xyz789",
  "signing_url": "https://app.example.com/public/sign/abc123xyz789",
  "expires_at": "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z"  // or null if no expiration
}
```

**Frontend Integration:**
- Contract cards on Lead Details page show signing link actions for ready/sent contracts
- "העתק קישור" (Copy Link) button - copies URL to clipboard with visual feedback
- "פתח" (Open) button - opens signing link in new tab
- "צור קישור" (Create Link) button appears if no link exists yet
- After creation, link is automatically copied to clipboard

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

---

#### For Internal User (Authenticated)
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/documents/{id}/sign`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "signer_name": "John Doe",
  "signer_email": "lawyer@example.com",  // Optional
  "signature_data": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG..."  // Base64 signature image
}
```

**Note:** `signer_type` removed - internal signing is implicit when authenticated user signs. The `contract_type` on document determines stage advancement (lawyer contracts only use internal signing).

**Process:**
1. Validates user authentication
2. Creates DocumentSignature record with `signer_type='internal'` and `signer_user_id`
3. Updates document status to `'signed'`
4. Auto-advances lead stage based on `contract_type`:
   - Lawyer contract → "חתום על ידי עורך דין" (Lawyer Signed - order 7)
5. Creates LeadStageHistory entry
6. Sets `completed_at` timestamp

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

---

  "signer_email": "john@example.com",
  "signature_data": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG...",
  "signer_type": "client"
}
```

**Process:**
1. Validate token and expiration
2. Check if link already used
3. Create DocumentSignature record with `signer_type='client'` and `signing_token`
4. Update document status to `'signed'`
5. Auto-advance lead stage based on document's `contract_type`:
   - Buyer contract → "חתום על ידי לקוח" (Buyer Signed - order 3)
   - Seller contract → "חתום על ידי מוכר" (Seller Signed - order 5)
   - Lawyer contract → "חתום על ידי עורך דין" (Lawyer Signed - order 7)
6. Mark signing link as used
7. Create LeadStageHistory entry
8. Log IP address and user agent
9. Set `completed_at` timestamp

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Signature submitted successfully",
  "document_status": "signed_by_client",
  "signature_id": 123
}
```

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

**Document Version:** 1.5  
**Last Updated:** January 2026  
**Latest Changes:**
- **Contract Workflow Implementation:**
  - Reorganized lead stages to match contract-specific workflow:
    1. ליד חדש (New Lead) - order: 1
    2. חוזה לקוח מוכן (Buyer Contract Ready) - order: 2
    3. חתום על ידי לקוח (Buyer Signed) - order: 3
    4. חוזה מוכר מוכן (Seller Contract Ready) - order: 4
    5. חתום על ידי מוכר (Seller Signed) - order: 5
    6. חוזה עורך דין מוכן (Lawyer Contract Ready) - order: 6
    7. חתום על ידי עורך דין (Lawyer Signed) - order: 7
  - Added `contract_type` field to Document model ('buyer', 'seller', 'lawyer')
  - Updated document statuses: 'draft', 'ready', 'sent', 'signed'
  - Stage advancement logic fixed to use stage names (instead of orders) to handle duplicates

- **Unified Editor:**
  - Created single `UnifiedEditor` component for both templates and documents
  - Template editor (`/templates/[id]/edit`) and document editor (`/documents/[id]/edit`) use same component
  - Document editor allows full editing of `rendered_content` (already merged with lead data)
  - Signature blocks can be edited independently from template
  - "Mark as Ready" button for draft contracts - saves changes, sets status to 'ready', and advances lead stage
  - Both editors use clean layout without sidebar/topbar

- **Document Management:**
  - Removed deprecated document view page (`/documents/[id]`)
  - All document interactions now use unified editor
  - Contract cards on Lead Details page show signing link actions:
    - Copy link button (copies to clipboard with feedback)
    - Open link button (opens in new tab)
    - Create link button (if no link exists, auto-creates and copies)
  - Separate tabs: "חוזים לחתימה" (Contracts to Sign) and "מסמכים חתומים" (Signed Documents)
  - Contract type selection in CreateDocumentModal (Buyer/Seller/Lawyer)
  - Automatic redirect to editor after document creation

- **Stage Timeline UX Improvements:**
  - Shows ALL stages (completed, current, upcoming)
  - Visual indicators: Green checkmark (completed), blue pulsing dot (current), gray clock (upcoming)
  - "נוכחי" (Current) and "הבא" (Next) badges
  - Shows completion date/time and user for completed/current stages
  - Proper RTL layout for Hebrew interface

- **Signing Link Management:**
  - Signing links displayed directly on contract cards for ready/sent contracts
  - One-click copy and open functionality
  - Auto-create link with automatic clipboard copy
  - Link generation updates document status to 'sent'
  - Removed all "Internal" signature references (simplified workflow)

- **Previous Phases:**
  - Phase 3.5: Signature capture component (`SignatureCanvas`)
  - Phase 3.6: Signing API endpoints (public and internal)
  - Phase 3.7-3.8: Document and signing pages
  - Phase 2 Complete: Google Docs-style template editor with multi-page A4 layout, merge fields, signature overlay, RTL support
